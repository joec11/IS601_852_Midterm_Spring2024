    Test calculation operations with various scenarios.
    
    This test ensures that the Calculation class correctly performs the arithmetic operation

    and that the result matches the expected outcome.
    
    Parameters:
        a (Decimal): The first operand in the calculation.
        b (Decimal): The second operand in the calculation.
        operation (function): The arithmetic operation to perform.
